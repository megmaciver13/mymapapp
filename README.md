# MyMapApp

### Purpose: technical interview at Blue Raster

### Completed:
- built UI using React
- used Materialize & Google Fonts to style header
- used git & branching to track approaches
- incorporated ESRI JS API into the app
- installed npm packaged 'react-arcgis', whose map component should render

### Prepared: 
- spatial data to render in map

### Challenges:
- map will no longer render
- setting up feature layer

### Did Not Get To:
- add spatial data to map using an ArcGIS FeatureLayer or MapImageLayer
- add pop ups for each layer to display info on that data
- add UI element to allow user to apply filters to each layer

#### Resources used:
- ArcGIS Developer Tools (e.g. [this](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/intro-mapview/index.html))
- Stack Overflow (e.g. [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45661619/inserting-map-scene-from-react-arcgis-with-legend-inside))
- NPM packages and tools
     - current approach using [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-arcgis) (more [here](https://github.com/nicksenger/react-arcgis))
